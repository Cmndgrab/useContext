useContext Tutorial!!!!!!

useContext is very useful for storing properties to beam down to components without the need to over utilize props. 
If you download this repo and run NPM start you will see that the classnames for the objects are being dynamically rendered by the useContext hook and stored within a useState. This allows you to dynamically change your elements without the need for complicated and non-verbose use of props. Try changing a few things yourself to see how it works!!!!!!!!
